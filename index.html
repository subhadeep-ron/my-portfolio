                Hi! I'm Subhadeep!! 
                You can call me "Ron" Also.
                Welcome to my Portfolio. 
                I am a research scholar in IAI (Institute for Advancing Intelligence) section at TCG CREST. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently pursuing my PhD here. My first year course work is ongoing right now. I 
                actually get to know a lot the fields of 
                "Cryptography", "Graph Algorithms", "Data structure and Algorithms" and "Discrete Mathematics".
                I also have a keen interest in "Complexity Theory".
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a basic knowledge in Computer Algorithms and Data Structures. Also I am efficient
                in C, Java, Python programming languages. I also know the basic structure of frontend-backend 
                development, API and Product Testing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides all of this, I have been working among the youths being attached with a non
                govermental organization named ABVYM (Akhil Bharat Vivekananda Yuva Mahamandal) for 
                more than 10 years. The organization actually works among the youths with the character-building
                and Life-making ideas proposed by Swami Vivekananda for the sake of our own society.
            </p>

            <h3>Two Remarks on Mycielski's Construction</h3>
            <p>
                I completed this project work as my dissertation during my post graduation under 
                the guidance of Dr. Ashok Kumar Das, Associate Professor, Department of Pure
                Mathematics, University of Calcutta.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jan Mycielski proposed a construction to make triangle free graphs i.e. 
                 graphs of clique number 2 but the chromatic number of graphs as large as
                 possible. It is a special type of construction and for each chromatic numbers
                 we get a seperate graphs derived from the previous graph.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this project, I proved that this type of graphs are <b>Hamiltonian</b> and <b>Color Critical</b> graphs.
