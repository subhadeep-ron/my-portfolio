                    Hi! I'm Subhadeep!! You can call me "Ron" Also. Welcome to my Portfolio. I am a research scholar in IAI (Institute for Advancing Intelligence) section at TCG CREST.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently pursuing my research journey under the guidance of 
                    <a href="https://www.tcgcrest.org/people/shion-samadder-chaudhury/" target="_blank">Dr. Shion Samadder Chaudhury</a> and <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/diptendu-chatterjee/" target="_blank">Dr. Diptendu Chatterjee</a>. 
                    Being engaged in first-year coursework, I am exploring a wide range of subjects including Expander Graphs, Cryptography, Graph Algorithms, Data Structures and Algorithms, Discrete Mathematics, Research Methodology, Research Ethics, Optimization Techniques, Approximation Algorithms, Probabilistic Methods, and more. 
                    Moreover, I have a keen interest in Complexity Theory and Theoretical Computer Science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a basic knowledge in Computer Algorithms and Data Structures. Also I am efficient
                    in C, Java, Python programming languages. I also know the basic structure of frontend-backend 
                    development, API and Product Testing. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides all of this, I have been working among the youths being attached with an organization named ABVYM (Akhil Bharat Vivekananda Yuva Mahamandal) for more than 11 years. The organization actually works among the youths with the character-building and life-making ideas proposed by Swami Vivekananda.

                <h3>Two Remarks on Mycielski's Construction</h3>
                <p>
                    I completed this project work as my dissertation during my post graduation under 
                    the guidance of Dr. Ashok Kumar Das, Associate Professor, Department of Pure
                    Mathematics, University of Calcutta.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jan Mycielski proposed a construction to make triangle free graphs i.e. 
                    graphs of clique number 2 but the chromatic number of graphs as large as
                    possible. It is a special type of construction and for each chromatic numbers
                    we get a seperate graphs derived from the previous graph.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this project, I proved that this type of graphs are <b>Hamiltonian</b> and <b>Color Critical</b> graphs.
